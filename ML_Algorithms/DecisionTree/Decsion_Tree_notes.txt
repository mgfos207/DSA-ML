When creating a Decision Tree

Need to have a cost function

DT's are an NP hard problem due to the permutations that you can
Do when splits

So to optimize this Decision Tree algorithms perform the cost locally
using a greedy approach

For our implementation we will be using information gain
In the greedy approach
